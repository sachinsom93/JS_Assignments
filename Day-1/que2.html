        <b>Var</b><br>
        <p>var is a function or global scope level variable.</p>
        <p>If var is used inside a function, it's scope is function level and it can be accessed only within the function.</p>
        <p>And, if it is declared outside of a function, then it's scope is global.</p>

        <b>let</b><br>
        <p>A variable declared in a block with let  is only available for use within that block.</p>
        <p>A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is a block.</p>

        <b>const</b><br>
        <p>Variables declared with the const maintain constant values.</p>
        <p>The value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared. So if we declare a variable with const.</p>
